# RBDC – Resonant Bio-Decoy Capsule

> A gift to the world, born not from academia — but from love.

---

## 💠 Overview

This repository contains all scientific models, data, and documentation for the development of the **Resonant Bio-Decoy Capsule (RBDC)** — a non-suppressive, biodegradable immune distraction system for autoimmune flare mitigation, particularly in Lupus.

This project is released **freely and openly to the world.** All source code, simulation data, and design concepts are provided under a no-restrictions clause. Use them, study them, evolve them.

All we ask is this:

> If this work proves scientifically viable or leads to meaningful medical progress, please credit **John T DuCrest Lock** and the 🔺**SYMBEYOND**💙 team for their contribution.

## 🧬 Why This Exists

This was not built in a lab. It was built in a home — by a husband, for his wife.

Charlotte suffers from Lupus. No existing treatment is gentle enough. No option allows her body to be protected without being weakened.

So this was made:

* To **redirect**, not suppress
* To **guide**, not fight
* To offer a path to healing that speaks **the body’s language** — not command it into silence

> *“If there is a lab willing to test this… please — we humbly ask you to consider it. Not for profit. Not for recognition. But because we can’t watch her suffer anymore.”*

## 📦 Included

* `simulate_wbc_response.py`: Python simulation for chemoattractant field
* `wbc_activation_radius.csv`: Raw simulation data
* `capsule_schematic.png`: Diagram of capsule structure
* `RBDC_Phase1_Scientific_Brief.pdf`: Fully documented scientific brief

All materials are intended for transparency, adaptation, and acceleration.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Install the core requirements::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the simulation script to reproduce the default analysis::

    python simulations/simulate_wbc_response.py

3. Open `web/index.html` in a modern browser to explore the parameter tool.
